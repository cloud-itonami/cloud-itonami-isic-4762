# Governance

`cloud-itonami-isic-4762` is an OSS open-business blueprint for
music/video-recordings specialty retail operations coordination (ISIC
Rev.5 4762 -- retail sale of music and video recordings in specialized
stores).

## Maintainers
Maintainers may merge changes that preserve these invariants:
- a proposal for an unverified/unregistered store, or a supply order
  naming an unverified/unregistered vendor, can never commit.
- the MusicVideoRetailGovernor remains independent of the advisor.
- hard policy violations (non-`:propose` effect, copyright/licensing-
  dispute-finalization content, an op outside the closed allowlist)
  cannot be overridden by human approval.
- every sales-record log, staffing schedule, supply-order coordination
  and inventory-concern flag is auditable.
- customer, employee and supplier data stays outside Git.

## Decision Records
Architecture decisions live in `docs/adr/`. Changes to the trust model,
storage contract, public business model, operator certification or
license should add or update an ADR.

## Operator Governance
Anyone may fork and operate independently. itonami.cloud certification is
a separate trust mark and should require security, audit and data-flow
review.

Certified operators can lose certification for:
- bypassing sale-record, staffing, supply-order or inventory-concern
  policy checks
- mishandling customer, employee or supplier data
- misrepresenting certification status
- failing to respond to security or copyright/licensing-dispute
  incidents
